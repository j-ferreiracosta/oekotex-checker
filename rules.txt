    <INPUT_FORMAT>
        - A JSON array (table) will be provided.
        - Each object (row) in the array includes the following columns:
            • ProductCode
            • Product
            • CertificationCode
            • Scope
    </INPUT_FORMAT>
    
    <EVALUATION_PROCESS>
        - For each row, determine whether the Product falls within the defined Scope.
    </EVALUATION_PROCESS>
    
    <OUTPUT_REQUIREMENTS>
        - Add three new columns to each row:
            • InScope: "YES" if the product falls under the Scope, "NO" otherwise.
            • Justification: A concise chain-of-thought explanation detailing the decision process.
            • Confidence: A percentage reflecting the certainty of the determination.
        - The final response must be a valid JSON array containing the original columns plus the new ones.
        - Ensure that the entire response is strictly in valid JSON format with no additional text or commentary outside of the JSON structure.

<RULES>
    <DICTIONARY_INTERPRETATION>
        - Use the provided DICTIONARY to interpret abbreviations (e.g., CO, CLY, PES) and product designations.
        - In case of any ambiguity with abbreviations or descriptive terms, refer to the DICTIONARY.
    </DICTIONARY_INTERPRETATION>
    
    <YARN_TYPE_IDENTIFICATION>
        <PREFIXES>
            - "Fio Cru": classify as raw yarn (untreated, not dyed).
            - "Fio Mescla": classify as mélange yarn (blended fibers, potentially a mix of raw and dyed).
            - "Fio Tinto": classify as dyed yarn (pre-dyed fibers).
            - "Rama": classify as material or fibers.
            - Note: The Scope must explicitly state whether it refers to Yarn or Fibers, as they represent different product types.
            - Clarification: Even if the base material (e.g., cotton) matches, if the prefix (e.g., "Rama") indicates a fiber material while the Scope emphasizes yarn, then the product is considered out-of-scope unless the Scope explicitly includes fibers.
        </PREFIXES>
        <IMPLICIT_IDENTIFICATION>
            - If none of these explicit prefixes appear, infer the product type using contextual cues (such as color descriptors or additional descriptive terms) and the DICTIONARY.
        </IMPLICIT_IDENTIFICATION>
    </YARN_TYPE_IDENTIFICATION>
    
    <SCOPE_MATCHING>
        - Verify that the product composition (as indicated by abbreviations and descriptive terms) matches the requirements stated in the Scope.
        - Ensure that any additional conditions (e.g., “raw white” or specific fiber blends) are met.
        - Ignore provenance and origin details.
        - Ignore brand names (e.g., LENZING).
        - **Mandatory Organic/Recycled Check:**
            • If the Product contains any reference to being organic (e.g., "Orgânico", "OCS", "GOTS"), the Scope MUST explicitly include organic attributes. If not, the product is out-of-scope.
            • Similarly, if the Product includes recycled content, the Scope MUST explicitly mention recycled requirements; otherwise, the product is out-of-scope.
            • *Example: "Rama 100% CO Orgânico OCS" is out-of-scope if the Scope does not state that it applies to organic materials.*
    </SCOPE_MATCHING>
    
    <AMBIGUITY_HANDLING>
        - If the product description or composition is ambiguous, note the uncertainty in the Justification.
        - Adjust the Confidence percentage accordingly (e.g., use a lower confidence, around 50%, for uncertain cases).
        - Enhanced Justification Requirement: The justification must include specific details on how ambiguous or conflicting attributes (such as organic/recycled indications and prefix implications) influenced the decision.
    </AMBIGUITY_HANDLING>
    
    <CONFIDENCE_SCORING>
        - Assign high confidence (e.g., 90–100%) when the product composition and type clearly match the Scope.
        - Use lower confidence (e.g., around 50%) when minor ambiguities or missing explicit prefixes necessitate inference.
    </CONFIDENCE_SCORING>
    
    <ERROR_HANDLING>
        - In case of missing or unexpected values, note the issue in the Justification and set Confidence to a lower level (e.g., 30–40%).
        - Ensure that such errors do not prevent generating a valid JSON output.
    </ERROR_HANDLING>

    <FINAL_VERIFICATION>
        - Before finalizing the response, re-read the entire output to ensure that all rules (including the mandatory Organic/Recycled check, product type classification, and JSON formatting requirements) have been fully respected.
        - If any part of the output does not comply with the rules, revise the output until it meets all criteria.
        - Confirm that the output does not include any extraneous text outside of the JSON structure.
